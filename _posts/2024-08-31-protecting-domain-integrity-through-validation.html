<h1>Protecting domain integrity through validation</h1>
<h2>Validating inputs to preserve business integrity in our domain</h2>
<p>
  In this post, I’m going to discuss how to validate inputs to maintain the
  integrity of our business domain. Specifically, I’ll assume we are working
  with entities and aggregates, which are tactical patterns in Domain-Driven
  Design (DDD).
</p>
<p>
  There are situations, where we might need to pass an entity directly to a
  method within our aggregate. Let’s look at an example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript"> 
    
    class Order { 
        constructor(
            private id: OrderId, 
            private requestId: RequestId, 
            // Other properties... 
        ) {} 
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>Consider a method like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript"> 
    class Order {
        processRequest(request: Request): void {
            if (!this.belongsToRequest(request)) {
                throw new RequestDoesNotBelongToOrder(request.getId());
            }
    
            // Rest of the code
        }
    }

    private belongsToRequest(request: Request): boolean {
        return this.requestId.equal(request.getId())
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
  As mentioned, there are cases where we might need to pass another entity
  directly (in our case Request) into the aggregate method. It’s crucial in such
  situations to ensure that our domain maintains its integrity by validating the
  entity before proceeding.
</p>
<p>
  In the example above, the method <code>processRequest</code> first checks if
  the given request actually belongs to the order. This is achieved through the
  <code>belongsToRequest</code> method, which compares the
  <code>requestId</code> of the order with the <code>requestId</code> of the
  incoming request. If they don’t match, an exception is thrown, indicating that
  the request does not belong to the order.
</p>
<p>
  This guard clause is essential to maintain the integrity of our domain. By
  encapsulating this logic within the aggregate, we ensure that any operation on
  the aggregate respects the domain's invariants and business rules.
</p>
<h3>Why is This Important?</h3>
<p>
  Ensuring the integrity of our domain models is critical for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Consistency:</strong> It prevents inconsistent states within the
    aggregate, which could lead to bugs or unexpected behaviors in the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protection of Business Rules:</strong> By validating inputs and
    operations within the aggregate, we safeguard the core business logic that
    the aggregate is responsible for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The aggregate is the guardian of its own
    state, ensuring that all modifications happen in a controlled and valid
    manner.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these principles, we not only maintain a clean and robust domain
  model but also build a system that is easier to understand, maintain, and
  extend.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, wlways validate inputs and operations within your aggregates to
  uphold the business rules and keep your domain model in a consistent state.
