<h1>Tell don't ask</h1>

<h2>Improve Code Readability and Maintainability with Tell Don't Ask</h2>

<p>
  You've likely encountered code that asks too much about an object's state
  before doing something. This is a common issue in software development and can
  lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. However, there's a
  solution: the "Tell Don't Ask" principle.
</p>

<p>
  This principle refers to the practice of avoiding explicit questions about an
  object's state before making a decision. Instead, you tell the object what to
  do and let it handle its own internal state.
</p>

<h3>Let's look at an example:</h3>

<p>
  Suppose we're working on an employee management system and we have an Employee
  class with a getSalary() method that returns the employee's salary:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
    class Employee {
        private salary: number;
      
        constructor(salary: number) {
          this.salary = salary;
        }
      
        getSalary(): number {
          return this.salary;
        }

        setSalary(amount: number): number {
          this.salary = amount
        }
    }
  </code></pre>

<p>
  Now, imagine we want to increase an employee's salary by 10%. We could do it
  in two ways: by asking for the employee's current salary and then applying the
  increase, or simply telling the employee to increase their salary. The first
  option it's like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
    const employee = new Employee(3000);
    if (employee.getSalary() < 5000) {
      const newSalary = employee.getSalary() * 1.1;
      employee.setSalary(newSalary);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
  This code is breaking the "Tell Don't Ask" principle because the object is not
  handling its own state as it should. To adhere to the principle, we would need
  to modify the code as follows to just tell the object to increse the salary:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
    const employee = new Employee(3000);
    employee.increaseSalary(0.1);
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
    class Employee {
        private salary: number;
    
        constructor(salary: number) {
            this.salary = salary;
        }
        
        increaseSalary(amount: number): void {
            if (this.salary < 5000) {
                const newSalary = this.salary * 1.1;
                this.salary = newSalary
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
  Instead of asking the object for its state and then making an external
  decision, we simply tell the object what to do, and it handles its own state
  according to internal logic.
</p>

<p>
  Following the "Tell Don't Ask" principle, we can write clearer, more concise,
  and maintainable code. This promotes better separation of concerns and
  facilitates code scalability and evolution over time.
