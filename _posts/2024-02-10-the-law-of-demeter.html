<h1>The Law of Demeter</h1>

<h2>Simplifying Object Communication</h2>

<p>
  The Law of Demeter, also known as the Principle of least knowledge, is a
  software design principle that promotes encapsulation and reduces coupling
  between objects. This principle states that an object should have limited
  knowledge about other objects and should only communicate with its "closest"
  friends. In simpler terms, an object should not have to "know" too much about
  the internal structure of other objects to perform its function.
</p>

<h3>What is the Law of Demeter?</h3>

<p>The Law of Demeter can be expressed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "An object should have access only to its own fields, the parameters it
    receives in its method calls, objects it creates internally, and objects
    passed in as method arguments."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This means that an object should not navigate through a chain of calls to
  interact with indirectly related objects. Instead, it should delegate that
  responsibility to closer objects.
</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>In this case I am going to show the example in Typescript:</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
  class Person {
    private name: string;
    private address: Address;
  
    constructor(name: string, address: Address) {
      this.name = name;
      this.address = address;
    }
  
    getName(): string {
      return this.name;
    }
  
    getAddress(): Address {
      return this.address;
    }
  }
  
  class Address {
    constructor(private street: string, private zip: string) {}
  
    getStreet(): string {
      return this.street;
    }
  
    getZip(): string {
      return this.zip;
    }
  }
    
  const address = new Address('Main Street');
  const person = new Person('John', address);
  
  console.log(`${person.getAddress.getStreet()}, ${this.address.getZip}`);
  </code></pre>

<p>In this case, we are breaking the Law of Demeter because we are exposing the Address class. To fix it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
class Person {
  private name: string;
  private address: Address;

  constructor(name: string, address: Address) {
    this.name = name;
    this.address = address;
  }

  getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }

  location(): string {
    return `${this.address.getStreet()}, ${this.address.getZip}`;
  }
}

class Address {
  constructor(private street: string, private zip: string) {}

  getStreet(): string {
    return this.street;
  }

  getZip(): string {
    return this.zip;
  }
}

const address = new Address('Main Street');
const person = new Person('John', address);

console.log(person.location());
</code></pre>

<p>
  As we can see, we get the street from a method called location from the Person
  class; this internally calls a getStreet and getZip methods from the Address
  class.
</p>
<p>
  Another important thing is not to expose unnecessary internal details in the
  naming. We need to focus on behavior based on the needs of the clients."
</p>

<h3>Benefits of the Law of Demeter</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Decoupling:</strong> By following the Law of Demeter, coupling
    between objects is reduced, making code maintenance and modification easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Data encapsulation is promoted by limiting
    direct access to other objects' fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Readability:</strong> Code becomes more readable and understandable
    since dependencies between objects are reduced, and clearer and more direct
    communication is encouraged.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  By following the Law of Demeter your code will be more modular and flexible,
  leading to a more robust and maintainable software design.
